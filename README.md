Student Wellness Virtual Assistant: 
A proactive health-monitoring tool developed to support students' physical and mental well-being. This assistant checks in on students, evaluates their symptoms, and provides immediate self-care advice or medical escalation.

Project Motivation:
Academic stress often leads to students neglecting their health. This project was created to bridge the gap between "feeling unwell" and "seeking help." It helps students distinguish between minor issues (like dehydration or burnout) and symptoms that require a professional medical opinion.

Features:
Active Check-ups: Specifically designed to monitor students who are struggling or underperforming due to health reasons.

Symptom Assessment: Analyzes user input to identify common ailments.

Self-Care Guidance: Provides actionable tips, such as:

Hydration reminders ("Take a drink of water").

Rest recommendations ("Take it easy for the rest of the day").

Stress management and recovery tips.

Medical Escalation: If symptoms are unrecognized or severe, the assistant explicitly directs the student to see a doctor or visit a clinic.

Medical Disclaimer:
IMPORTANT: This tool is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a licensed medical diagnostic tool. Users should never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something provided by this application.


How It Works:
Greeting: The assistant initiates a conversation to check on the student's status.

Symptom Input: The student describes their symptoms or discomfort.

Diagnosis Logic:

Case A (Minor): Suggests lifestyle adjustments (water, sleep, breaks).

Case B (Moderate): Provides specific "healing tips" for common colds or fatigue.

Case C (Severe/Unknown): Triggers a "Consult a Doctor" warning.
